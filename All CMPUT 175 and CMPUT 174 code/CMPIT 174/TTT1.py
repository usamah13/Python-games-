# Tic Tac Toe Version 1
# 
# 3x3 grid of rectangles are displayed. There are two
# players, one X, one O. X goes first and players take
# turns clicking on tiles. The player's letter appears on
# an empty tile when clicked. If three of the same letters
# appear in a row, the corresponding player wins.
#
# Version 1 implements: drawing of the 9 tiles, and the
# ability to click on a tile to set its content to 'X'. Only
# one player exists in version 1.
